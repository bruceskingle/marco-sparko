# Marco Sparko Capture Device

Firmware for an ESP32 which polls what Marco Sparko needs while the computer it runs on sleeps, built on
[sparko-embedded-std](../../sparko-embedded-std), which must be checked out next to this repo. It polls the Tesla
gateway, myenergi's zappi and Octopus's smart charging, and keeps what it gets on an SD card. It runs on:

- a CYD (ESP32-2432S028R), whose screen shows a clock with the latest numbers below, the default;
- a Waveshare ESP32-C6-Touch-LCD-1.47, an ESP32-C6, whose small screen shows only the numbers, with the
  `waveshare-c6-touch` feature. Its SD card slot shares the display's SPI bus.

## Building and flashing

From this directory, with the ESP Rust toolchain installed (see sparko-embedded-std):

- `cargo build --release` for a CYD, and `cargo run --release` flashes the CYD plugged in by USB, and shows its log.
- For the Waveshare, which is RISC-V: `MCU=esp32c6 cargo build --release --target riscv32imac-esp-espidf
  --no-default-features --features waveshare-c6-touch`, then `espflash flash --port /dev/cu.usbmodem...
  target/riscv32imac-esp-espidf/release/marco-sparko-capture`.
- `python3 log.py [port]` shows a device's log without restarting it (needs pyserial). Not `espflash monitor`, which
  restarts it, or with `--no-reset` leaves it stopped in its bootloader. The CYD's port is `/dev/cu.usbserial-*`, its
  USB chip's, the Waveshare's `/dev/cu.usbmodem*`, the chip's own USB.

In VS Code, Terminal > Run Task has **Device: Flash CYD**, **Device: Flash Waveshare**, **Device: Log CYD** and
**Device: Log Waveshare**, which find the port.

## Setting it up

The first time it starts, it makes its own WiFi network: join it and the config page opens. Enter your WiFi details,
then in the TeslaCapture section:

- **tesla_host**: the gateway's IP address.
- **tesla_email** and **tesla_password**: the gateway's customer login, as in the app. A password the gateway
  rejects is removed, so it is not tried again. Repeated failures lock out the customer login, for Home Assistant
  too.
- **tesla_schedule**: optional, when to poll, a cron spec with seconds first, `0 */5 * * * *` (every 5 minutes) if
  empty.
- **tesla_capacity**: optional, how many samples to keep in RAM, 48 (4 hours at 5 minutes) if empty. The SD card
  keeps the rest. The log shows the free heap after each poll.

The config page never shows the password, and it is not written to the log: leave it empty to keep the saved one.
The page has no login though, so anyone on the network can change the settings, including tesla_host, which would
send the password to another address. TODO: a login for the config page.

Then enter the device's IP address on the app's Powerwall page.

## What the app reads

`GET /capture/tesla/records?since=<RFC 3339 time>` returns `{"device": {...}, "records": [...]}`:

- `device`: its version, when and why it last started (`resetReason`, e.g. `Brownout`), how many records it keeps,
  and its free heap.
- `records`: those after `since`, or all of them, oldest first, each as the app's own Tesla snapshots, with `slot`,
  `requested`, `received`, `capturedBy` and the `responses` of `meters/aggregates`, `system_status/soe`,
  `system_status/grid_status` and `operation`, keeping only the fields the app uses.

The records are only kept in RAM, so they are lost when the device restarts.

The same records are at `https://<device>/api/capture/tesla/records`, on the device's HTTPS API, which also has
`/api/info`, `/api/config` and `/api/restart`, see sparko-embedded-std's CLAUDE.md. Its certificate is the device's
own, so use `curl -k` for now; the app will pin its fingerprint, from `/api/info`, when it adopts the device.

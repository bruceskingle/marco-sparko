//! Electricity imported and exported, combined from all the readings there are: the meters' half hourly readings, which
//! split the import into the rates it is billed at, e.g. Home Low Rate, but arrive a few days later, and the Home Mini's
//! readings every 10 seconds, which are up to date but not split, and only go back as far as they were saved, see
//! telemetry.rs.
//!
//! The energy of each half hour is from the Home Mini if it has all of the half hour's readings, as it has the detail
//! within the half hour, otherwise from the meters. The two agree to within 0.1% over a half hour. The Home Mini's
//! import is split into the labels of the import meter's reading for the half hour, in its proportions. That is exact
//! for the rates, as each half hour is billed at one rate. Within the half hour the car's share is placed as a block at
//! the charger's power, as the car charges at a constant power, and the rest is the house's, see split_half_hour. The
//! car can not be told apart from the house's other loads by the power alone, e.g. a home battery charging at night.
//!
//! Import in a half hour which the meter has no reading for yet, e.g. today, is estimated to be at the low rate if it is
//! in the tariff's cheap times, or on an Intelligent Octopus tariff, if the car was charging, as outside the cheap times
//! it only charges the car during dispatches, which are at the low rate, otherwise at the standard rate, see Estimate.
//! On other tariffs charging outside the cheap times is at the standard rate. The car's share is not estimated. If the
//! tariff's cheap times are not known the import is UNMETERED_LABEL.
//!
//! Where the Tesla gateway's registers were captured through a half hour too, every few seconds by a capture device, see
//! tesla/snapshot.rs, the half hour's import is split by what it was used for instead, see measured_split: the car's is
//! the Home Mini's import less the gateway's, as the zappi is outside the gateway's meter, the Powerwalls' what they took
//! in less what the solar panels made, and the rest the house's, each in the rates of the meter's labels. That is
//! measured, unlike the meter's EV labels, which Octopus models, e.g. as the same energy every half hour of a charge,
//! which is kept for each point to compare, see ElectricityPoint::ev_comparison. Over a night of charging the car's was
//! within 0.2% of the zappi's own total.
//!
//! The thresholds for seeing the car charging, CHARGING_POWER_SHARE and CHARGING_READINGS, were chosen from one
//! household's readings, with a 7 kW charger, on Intelligent Octopus Go: over 855 half hours of October 2026 the
//! estimate agreed with the meter for all but 9, each of which were either a little charging at a low power or a short
//! high load in the house. A home battery charging outside the cheap times would be taken for the car.

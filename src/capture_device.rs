//! Capture devices: ESP32s, see capture/ in this repo, which poll what the modules need while the computer sleeps, and
//! which the app manages through their HTTPS API, see sparko-embedded-std's api.rs.
//!
//! A device's certificate is one it made itself, so the app pins it: it notes the certificate's fingerprint the first
//! time it connects, checks it against what the device says in /api/info, and from then on only talks to a device with
//! that certificate, see PinnedCertificate. Adopting a device, see adopt, gives it a key the app made, which every
//! request but /api/info then needs.
//!
//! Reading, e.g. /api/info for the Devices page, and a device's records, is over plain HTTP, as HTTPS needs tens of KB
//! of a device's RAM, which it may not have while it polls over HTTPS itself. Reads of records are signed with the key,
//! see sign, so that it is never sent where it could be seen. Changes, e.g. of the config, which has passwords in it,
//! and adoption, which sends the key, are over HTTPS.

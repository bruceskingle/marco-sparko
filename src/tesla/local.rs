//! Requests to the local API of a Tesla Powerwall's gateway, on the home network, which is not documented by Tesla,
//! see https://github.com/jasonacox/pypowerwall
//!
//! Other programs, e.g. Home Assistant, use the gateway too, so this must never get in their way:
//! - Only the GET requests in ENDPOINTS are made, which change nothing.
//! - It logs in as the customer, which cannot change installer settings, and reuses the token it is given.
//! - A rejected password is never tried again, as repeated failures lock out the customer login, for every program.

"""Compares Home Assistant's history of an EV charger with what Octopus billed, from Marco Sparko's Octopus cache.

Three questions:
- Was each half hour billed at the low or the standard rate, and does Home Assistant's off peak sensor agree?
- When charging runs on past the end of a half hour, what was the next half hour billed at?
- How do Octopus's charging session totals compare with the charger's own energy added since plug in, and with the
  charger's power readings added up over time? Each session is compared until the next one starts, as Octopus's end
  of a session is when the car was to be ready by, and charging often carries on after it.

Export the history from Home Assistant's History page (Download data) with the charger's charge added and charge power
sensors and the Octopus integration's off peak binary sensor, then run, e.g.

    scripts/ha-vs-octopus.py --profile default history.csv [more.csv ...]

Several exports can be given, e.g. for consecutive date ranges. Only half hours and sessions inside the history are
compared. Half hours Octopus has not made final may still change.

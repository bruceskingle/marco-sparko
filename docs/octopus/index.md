# Octopus Energy Plugin
Information relating to the Octopus Energy API and the Marco Sparko implementation thereof.

Octopus provides two APIs REST and GraphQL. Marco Sparko uses the GraphQL API.

Octopus Energy provide some [Official API docs](https://developer.octopus.energy) which should obviously be treated as definitive, anything here is an external attempt to clarify and explain by external introspection. The official documentation appears to be largely generated which has the advantage that it is correct (or at least reflects the implemented reality), but this does not necessarily help to explain what everything actually means very well. The documentation here is largely written as an aid to writing the Marco Sparko Octopus plugin, but I hope it may also be useful to others who may be trying to use the API.

[Web UI Queries](webUiQueries.md) shows details of the queries made to the GraphQL API by the Octopus Energy Account Dashboard application.
